# mStable Dev Grants

## Overview

mStable Dev Grants are our way of funding community efforts to contribute to and grow the mStable ecosystem of products, tools, and utility.

At this point in time, teams can apply for up to $50k in funding through the Dev Grants process. Any teams looking to secure more funding than this should consider breaking the project down into multiple grant proposals, which we will fund sequentially.

## Aims

mStable is looking to invest in the following ecosystem verticals:

- MTA integration into applications (MTA utility, mStable SDK)
- mUSD / mBTC integrations (mAsset utility)
- Community tools (explorers, wallets, .info sites, forums, etc.)
- Marketing / community building

If you have an idea which you think fits into one of the above categories, we encourage you to apply for a grant. If you're unsure, feel free to connect with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/y2r3jXm) or [Email](mailto:grants@mstable.org).

## RFPs

mStable also has a list of Requests For Proposal (RFPs) which can help you if you do not have an idea or your own or want some inspiration. They can be found in the `/rfps` folder of this repository.

## Application Process

There are two ways to apply for a grant, either publicly or privately.

### Public Application:

- Fork this GitHub repository
- Create a markdown file named after your team in `/proposals`
- Copy over the template from `/proposals/_template.md`
- Modify as needed
- If the proposal is a direct response to an RFP, make sure to include the RFP number in the filename
- Create a pull request to this repository from your own fork

### Private Application:

- Grab the markdown file from `/proposals/_template.md`
- Modify as needed
- Send the proposal to [grants@mstable.org](mailto:grants@mstable.org)

We aim to get back to each grant submission within a fortnight.

## Submission Requirements

All submissions should have, at a __bare minimum__:

- An Open-source Git repository
- Either Apache 2.0 or GPLv3 License
- Detailed instructions on how to build the project locally
- Walkthrough of the project either via a document or video

We would be very grateful if submissions included a Dockerfile so that we can avoid environment incompatibilities.

## Evaluation Process

After you have completed the work, send a written confirmation of your submission (including the above items) to grants@mstable.org with the subject line `Grant Submission for [Team Name]`.

We aim to get everyone paid within 30 days of this first submission, and if any amendments are necessary we aim to notify you within 14 days of this initial submission.
